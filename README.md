# Datapipeline
This project automates the process of collecting and organizing data about Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. It gathers movie and character details from Wikipedia, adds extra information from the OMDB API, and saves the data in an AWS S3 bucket for further use.
The data stored in S3 is in csv format.
